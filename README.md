***traJulia. Amateur Rocket Flight Simulation***

traJulia is a computational tool designed to simulate the flight trajectory of amateur rockets.

Key features of traJulia are:
- Lightning-fast simulations thanks to Julia, a state-of-the-art programming language.
- In-built Monte Carlo capabilities to provide meaningful launch statistics, producing not just a landing point but a landing area.
- A variety of aerodynamic models included, with the option to input your own trusted data.
- Free and open-source.
- 
The tool is currently under development; visit the development blog for more details.
